Hi guys,

I am not a developer, am still trying to learn how to build sites.

MY two sites were infected and damaged when I made the horrible mistake of hosting them at godaddy.

After a long battle I was able to put them online, but something is missing, the layout is just not there.

Please take a look and let me know?

Tks
